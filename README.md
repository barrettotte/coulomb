My dev/ctf environment

Based on Debian 12.2.0

Ideally, I want this to be a standalone setup and not just on a VM.

## VM

- Basic debian install
- 256GB disk
- 16GB RAM
- 1 processor, 8 cores per processor
- XFCE desktop

## TODO:

- firefox bookmarks

## After `setup.sh`

- setup github cli `gh auth login`
- sign into vscode for env sync
